author: Guus "mr Bot" Hoeve
summary: Writing code is a lot about rewriting code, but the hidden element of
  good code is readability by others. How our brains work and memorize code, is
  not how you actually read code. We remember a narrative in the code, and
  continue a storyline to the end. Like a good book does that is unfinished yet.
metaDescription: A personal opinion on the importance of DX copywriting, and the
  importance of narrative in code.
