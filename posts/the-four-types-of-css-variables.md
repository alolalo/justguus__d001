title: The Four Types of (CSS) Variables

summary: There are four types of CSS Variables that I use to communicate what
  they do in a design system; literal tokens, relative tokens, lateral tokens,
  and negated tokens (the not chosen ones). This article is mainly driven for a
  better DX by copywriting, rather than to define a "new standard" for how to
  write or apply them.

# .: KTBF :. The 4x(+1) types of CSS Variables

# .: How I @layer CSS logical properties

There’s a difference between logical properties and variables; **who they belong to**. Variables are the values that you use to layer the logical properties to use later on. 

Concurrence, first hand before the fact. But since there are @layers coming to CSS that will help you define your layering in CSS design systems, are there no layers too in logical properties?

The answer is yes, but you have to understand that CSS itself already has a convention that it likes to use in naming: **literal and relative** unit-values, which make a lot of sense knowing how many values you can use for your design needs.

Yet we constantly see just that; a **two-demensional** pattern of linear design of code that is often presented in **pairs or threes**. 

Well I think it’s time to give literal and relative, the rock and the paper, a new cut by introducing a third player to form a RockPaperScissor formation: **Lateral**

But that only goes for values, not logical properties; they are just that. 

Properties of the logic you wish to achieve with them in your design of coded solution. All of that is changing now, right now! CSS can do so much more these days, it’s designer’s golden moment to start applying it today!

By the power of Two, let me introduce Una Kravets, Chrome Developer Relations at Google, who shared this video about the importance of knowing !important in the near future. That’s now btw.

A simple rule like !important will have a dramatic effect on how designers will create classes in the future, now that @layers will *double* the cascade-opportunities for it. That’s great news if you know how to control it, because it also means double-trouble if you don’t. 

So I hope that *before the fact*, I already have your attention on where I draw the line between the front of the front, and the back of the back. There are no experts, only relevant originals.

## Words of Image: The 4X(+1) Types of Design Token Layers

The power of Circles has a root; Pi

The power of Comuter Science has a root: Two

The power of CSS has a root; specificity

The power of naming things in has a root; layered relativity

I recently found a nice way to structure the way I layer and cascade my design tokens in CSS logical properties. 

There are F**our (+1) types of design tokens** you can group and identify this way;

### 1. Literal Tokens (@base)

### 2. Relative Tokens (@layer)

### 3. Nested Tokens (@theme)

### 4. Lateral Tokens (@utilities)

### (4+1). Negated Tokens (@JIT)

Why is this !important? Well in the future every design system will follow one rule; non-destructive layering and consistent constructive & deconstructive demand. Faster.

But if only our technology advances in layers, and we don’t realize it’s language itself that was once spoken, then written, and now being automated, we need to realize that our very own C in ICT needs to follow suit; evolve

## Layers, Layers, Layers & Unions

Addative, subtractive & formative layers of technology often obscure the human factor that comes into play before the fact. The “reading experience” is too much focussed on tech.

The factory-model preaches a simple forward narrative of the outcome first, and there lie the steps **you don’t get to name anymore** because that layer is already named there. 

Those are the unions of Tailwind to me, that you can’t name anything or structure it the way you want. It’s their way or no-way at all that people will all stick to “the source of truth”.

That to me is the biggest concern why you should not use a framework for your own custom design system (unless you’re going to test it first); you have to adopt other people’s naming and translation of mechnical engineering concepts. 

Because software lives on hardware and is used by people, so sorry but to be the more human-centered designer here, it’s humanistic to start with putting humans to work there don’t you think? So why do people complain about Tailwind after the fact?...

They simply didn’t know how to create their own design system, because they simply couldn’t name things in a structural way that speaks a semantical & systematical language we all speak.

One tongue, One language, One system. A design system is a strict product of language and CS evolution, and is often not well enough understood from it’s roots; symbolism.

### The Identity ©, Voice ℗, & Ownership® of .: BOU~M :.

BOU~M is something I made “copyrighted intellectual property” since it’s an axiomatic & semaforic pattern I developed myself in design and code. 

It took me **2,5 years to master** all by myself, because the true art is that using BOU~M in your code actually **protects your brand identity.** In short; B.O.U.~M protects your IP by nesting itself inside your design system tokens.

As an identity of copyright, a voice of copyright, and ownership of production-rights; words are no less of an ownership than your own identity and voice, especially if they hold up in CS and can be reproduced to exact specifications.

And I’m not alone in this field, many now find themselves trapped in Web2.5; privacy & identity owned by technolgy;

Yet nobody recognizes the people behind the original work anymore, they just copy what you make and that’s human. 

Don’t worry, it’s cheap to get a boum-license since it’s business-model is “Indie”. My prices are affordable and desireable for all that want to have an actual licence that **adds value to business**.

That’s why you pay for BOU~M, or you don’t if you don’t make any money, too. 

And for the record; you **can’t use it** to produce NFT’s or in any crypto-powered products, first or third-party. 

Why? I don’t support fantasy-realities that use the real-world like a game-world, including it’s people and the planet that supports it. That’s just not ethical to me, besides future-perfect clean-NFT’s that do not exist yet. 

Patience artists, I’m not against you, just the practice of crypto; the root of the evil.

But now that you understand that naming things is intellectual property, or you can literally say goodbye to any type of ownership with the dawn of Web3.0; 

the loss of your voice, your colors, your identity, your ownership of creating things in digital matter because someone before & after you said “GIMME GIMME GIMME!”. 

Where’s the consent in that, crypto-gods of color? How does that feel like an evolution of the web, if it uses it to censor me tbw?

As long as “what’s yours is yours, what’s mine is mine” remains in balance. Crypto or not, it’s the statement that counts.

.: BOU~M :. is such a naming convention and system that is driven by the language itself to be applied to **creational design patterns,** such as the abstract-factory-model. A CS-principle I invented over the last years.

Because how else can .: BOU~M :. exist or have came to existence? And second, who else cares about it but me so far? Yes indeed, naming is an indie thing; The Original Coca Cola.
