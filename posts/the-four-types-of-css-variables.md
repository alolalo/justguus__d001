title: The Four Types of (CSS) Variables

author: Guus "mr Bot" Hoeve
summary: There are four types of CSS Variables that I use to communicate what
  they do in a design system; literal tokens, relative tokens, lateral tokens,
  and negated tokens (the not chosen ones). This article is mainly driven for a
  better DX by copywriting, rather than to define a "new standard" for how to
  write or apply them.
