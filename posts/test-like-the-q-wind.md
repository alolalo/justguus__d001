# Hello Guus!

Hi, I'm justgu.us and this is my attempt at shaking up and waking up some designers & developers, *especially* copywriters too, to practice some "new CSS" because... 

It's just awesome as a **prototyping & testing** tool for your design to final code steps! See most people probably don't get the origin of `code;` it's a language, not a production-ready standard to comply with from the start.

As a (game) designer I write design rules in the CSS programming language based on my design system layered architecture, which today doesn't use the cascade anymore to explain how it works; I expalin it like Photoshop now, with layers of "watering down".

CSS uses @layers now that will make you feel right at home coming from any graphical application, except this is how a developer layers their artwork; using a language.

I intentionally mentioned I'm a game designer here, as games are closed systems of feed-forward and feed-back to not only the player-space (UX) but also the maker-space (DX). 

They apply the right kind of restrictions to allow the movement and freedom within the space. You think you can do anything in a modern game, but it's the opposite actually.

See, naming things is so important because if you don't have an idea of what I'm about to tell you, you will assume *the first thing I say.* So a little friction is good sometimes.

And that is what this post is actually about; what if **the word CSS**, that stands for Cascading Style Sheet, was named Closed System Set language that enables us to design systems in the browser.

Yes, it's a horrible name new name for CSS. Yes, it doesn't sound sexy. Yes, it will even create a bigger feeling of nerdy disgust to say Closed Styled System, but it finally frames it as something functional, and not purely easthetical.

And no, I'm not asking for a rewrite of the term. I'm asking for a shift in context; let's start testing things with CSS!

My point is simple; if we only say CSS is for styling, and not for programming our own closed system of styling things with the browser, I don't think people will actually get the new CSS to begin with. 

It's a functional programming language that enables most to program design as a rule-based system. Not a cascading system of nested and inherited classes, although that's much friendlier to do nowadays. 

No it is already enabling far more people to think outside of the falacy-box of "a programmer", which to my indigenous dutch sense of self is just another word for

I'm saying that I'm walking away from talking like some pretentiously friendly & kind developer for the sake of a better human experience.

You know, that default we constantly need to be reminded about... It's like we suffer more from our own brainwashing ourselves into humanity, but never actually show its grace.

Because naming things in code is one of the two hardest things in CS, and that's exactly why copywriters would be great programmers in the "new CSS" if you ask me.

So what am I saying? Well, we need to *relanguage CSS* a bit, because it still sounds "dusty, dirty & nerdy" to the many. Because of how it's *named & framed*.

I'm not the only one making a point about this; Ahmad Shadeed wrote about the contextual shift that we can undergo too to see CSS differently, and my take is *testing in the browser.*

It will never be production-ready because that's not what it was meant for; it was meant to make your stuff production-ready faster by seeing what is happening with --Q.
